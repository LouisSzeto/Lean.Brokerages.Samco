## Introduction

This repository hosts the Samco Brokerage Plugin Integration with the QuantConnect LEAN Algorithmic Trading Engine. LEAN is a brokerage agnostic operating system for quantitative finance. Thanks to open-source plugins such as this [LEAN](https://github.com/QuantConnect/Lean) can route strategies to almost any market.

[LEAN](https://github.com/QuantConnect/Lean) is maintained primarily by [QuantConnect](https://www.quantconnect.com), a US based technology company hosting a cloud algorithmic trading platform.

[Samco](https://www.samco.in/) was founded by Jimeet Modi in 2015 with a mission of providing retail investors access to sophisticated financial technology that can assist retail investors in creating wealth at a low cost. Samco provides access to India Equities for clients in India with no minimum balance. Samco also provides stock ratings, mutual funds, and a mini-portfolio investment platform.


## Using the Brokerage Plugin
  
### QuantConnect Cloud

  This plugin is integrated in the QuantConnect Cloud Platform where you can use this integration with a simple visual interface, and harness the QuantConnect Live Data Feed. For most users this is substantially cheaper and easier than self-hosting. For more information see the [Samco brokerage documentation](https://www.quantconnect.com/docs/v2/our-platform/live-trading/brokerages/samco). 
  
### Locally

Follow these steps to start local live trading with the Samco brokerage:

1.  Open a terminal in your [CLI root directory](https://www.quantconnect.com/docs/v2/lean-cli/initialization/directory-structure#02-lean-init).
2.  Run lean live "`<projectName>`" to start a live deployment wizard for the project in ./`<projectName>` and then enter the brokerage number.

    ```
    $ lean live 'My Project'
     
    Select a brokerage:
    1. Paper Trading
    2. Interactive Brokers
    3. Tradier
    4. Oanda
    5. Bitfinex

    11. Atreyu
    12. Trading Technologies
    13. Kraken
    14. FTX
    Enter an option: 
    ```
  
3.  Enter the number of the organization that has a subscription for the Samco module.

    ```
    $ lean live "My Project" 

    Select the organization with the Samco module subscription:
    1. Organization 1
    2. Organization 2
    3. Organization 3
       Enter an option: 1
    ```

4.  Enter your Samco credentials.

    ```
    $ lean live "My Project" 
    Client ID:
    Client Password:
    Year of Birth:
    ```

5.  Enter your Samco product type.

    ``` 
    $ lean live "My Project"

    The product type must be set to MIS if you are targeting intraday products, CNC if you are targeting delivery products
    or NRML if you are targeting carry forward products.
    Product type (mis, cnc, nrml) [MIS]:
    ```

6.  Enter your Samco trading segment.

    ``` 
    $ lean live "My Project"

    The trading segment must be set to EQUITY if you are trading equities on NSE or BSE, or COMMODITY if you are trading
    commodities on MCX.
    Trading segment (equity, commodity) [EQUITY]:
    ```

7.  Enter the number of the data feed to use and then follow the steps required for the data connection.

    ``` 
    $ lean live 'My Project'

    Select a data feed:
    1. Interactive Brokers
    2. Tradier
    3. Oanda
    4. Bitfinex
    5. Coinbase Pro
    6. Binance
    7. Zerodha
    8. Samco
    9. Terminal Link
    10. Trading Technologies
    11. Kraken
    12. FTX
    13. IQFeed
    14. Polygon Data Feed
    15. Custom Data Only
  
        To enter multiple options, separate them with comma:
    ```

If you select IQFeed, see [IQFeed](https://www.quantconnect.com/docs/v2/lean-cli/live-trading/other-data-feeds/iqfeed) for set up instructions.  
If you select Polygon Data Feed, see [Polygon](https://www.quantconnect.com/docs/v2/lean-cli/live-trading/other-data-feeds/polygon) for set up instructions.

8. View the result in the `<projectName>`/live/`<timestamp>` directory. Results are stored in real-time in JSON format. You can save results to a different directory by providing the --output `<path>` option in step 2.

If you already have a live environment configured in your [Lean configuration file](https://www.quantconnect.com/docs/v2/lean-cli/initialization/configuration#03-Lean-Configuration), you can skip the interactive wizard by providing the --environment `<value>` option in step 2. The value of this option must be the name of an environment which has live-mode set to true.

## Account Types

Samco supports cash and margin accounts that trades in Indian Rupees.

## Order Types and Asset Classes


Samco supports trading India Equities with the following order types:

- Market Order
- Limit Order
- Limit-If-Touch Order
- Stop-Market Order
- Stop-Limit Order
- Market-On-Open Order
- Market-On-Close Order


## Downloading Data

For local deployment, the algorithm needs to download the following dataset:

[India Equities](https://www.quantconnect.com/datasets/truedata-india-equities) provided by TrueData
[India Equity Security Master](https://www.quantconnect.com/datasets/truedata-india-equity-security-master) provided by TrueData


## Brokerage Model

Lean models the brokerage behavior for backtesting purposes. The margin model is used in live trading to avoid placing orders that will be rejected due to insufficient buying power.

You can set the Brokerage Model with the following statements
```
SetBrokerageModel(BrokerageName.Samco, AccountType.Cash);
SetBrokerageModel(BrokerageName.Samco, AccountType.Margin);
```
[Read Documentation](https://www.quantconnect.com/docs/v2/our-platform/live-trading/brokerages/samco)

### Fees

We model the order fees of Samco by its Equity Intraday fee structure. The following table shows the fees:

| Charge Item | Fee |
| --- | --- |
| Brokerage Fee | â‚¹20 per trade or 0.02% (whichever is lower) |
| Exchange Transaction Charge | 0.00345% |
| Securities Transaction Tax | 0.025% |
| Goods and Services Tax | 18% |
| SEBI Charges | 0.0001% |
| Stamp Duty | 0.003% |

To check the latest fees, see the [Regulatory and Exchanges Charges page](https://www.samco.in/charge-list-equities-and-equity-derivatives) on the Samco website.

### Margin

We model buying power and margin calls to ensure your algorithm stays within the margin requirements.

[Read Documentation](https://www.quantconnect.com/docs/v2/our-platform/live-trading/brokerages/samco)

#### Buying Power

Samco allows up to 5x leverage for margin accounts, but the amount of margin available depends on the Equity and product type. To check the amount of margin available for each asset, see the [Equities Margin Calculator](https://www.samco.in/span/equity) on the Samco website.

#### Margin Calls

Regulation T margin rules apply. When the amount of margin remaining in your portfolio drops below 5% of the total portfolio value, you receive a [warning](https://www.quantconnect.com/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/reality-modeling/margin-calls#08-Monitor-Margin-Call-Events). When the amount of margin remaining in your portfolio drops to zero or goes negative, the portfolio sorts the generated margin call orders by their unrealized profit and executes each order synchronously until your portfolio is within the margin requirements.

### Slippage

Orders through Samco do not experience slippage in backtests. In live trading, your orders may experience slippage.

### Fills

We fill market orders immediately and completely in backtests. In live trading, if the quantity of your market orders exceeds the quantity available at the top of the order book, your orders are filled according to what is available in the order book.

### Settlements

If you trade with a margin account, trades settle immediately. If you trade with a cash account, Equity trades settle 3 days after the transaction date (T+3).

### Deposits and Withdraws

You can deposit and withdraw cash from your brokerage account while you run an algorithm that's connected to the account. We sync the algorithm's cash holdings with the cash holdings in your brokerage account every day at 7:45 AM Eastern Time (ET).

LEAN Engine is an open-source algorithmic trading engine built for easy strategy research, backtesting, and live trading. We integrate with common data providers and brokerages, so you can quickly deploy algorithmic trading strategies.

The core of the LEAN Engine is written in C#, but it operates seamlessly on Linux, Mac and Windows operating systems. To use it, you can write algorithms in Python 3.6 or C#. QuantConnect maintains the LEAN project and uses it to drive the web-based algorithmic trading platform on the website.
